# Raw Input

:::tip
We very much recommend that you only use this if you can't use input actions for whatever reason. You can't rebind these at all.

:::


We have the ability to access keyboard inputs directly, bypassing input actions. 

```csharp
//
// Is the W key down this frame?
//
if ( Input.Keyboard.Down( "W" ) )
{
    Log.Info( "W is down!" );
}

//
// Was the W key pressed this frame?
//
if ( Input.Keyboard.Pressed( "W" ) )
{
    Log.Info( "W was pressed!" );
}

//
// Was the W key released this frame?
//
if ( Input.Keyboard.Released( "W" ) )
{
    Log.Info( "W was released!" );
}
```
