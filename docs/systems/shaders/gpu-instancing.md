# GPU Instancing

GPU instancing is an optimization where multiple instances of the same model with the same material can be drawn in a single draw call. This is a big optimization when rendering things that appear many times in a scene such as foliage.

## Standard Instancing

Everything is automatically instanced by default, if the renderer can batch your models into 1 draw call it will.

To get the Object→World matrix in your vertex shader you use the following function:

```cpp
float3x4 CalculateInstancingObjectToWorldMatrix( const VS_INPUT i );
```

Extra per instance data can be grabbed by using:

```cpp
ExtraShaderData_t GetExtraPerInstanceShaderData( const VS_INPUT i );
```

ExtraShaderData allows you to still have instances even though some data is different between them, currently only tint color is changeable within instances:

```cpp
struct ExtraShaderData_t
{
	float4 vTint;
	uint nBlendWeightCount;			// if D_SKINNING, blend weight count
};
```

Instances can be drawn manually in C# with: `Graphics.DrawModelInstanced( Model, Span<Transform> )` this allows you to draw 1000s of instances without burdening the scene system.

## Procedural Instancing

Procedural instancing is useful for programmatic shaders that are to be invoked from C# or indirectly.\nNo transforms are passed only the count of instance ids, you would derive some form of transform yourself from them within the shader.

You can get the instance id from SV_InstanceID in your vertex function.

This is also useful for indirect draw calls.

```cpp
PixelInput MainVs( VertexInput i, uint instanceID : SV_InstanceID )
{ 
    float3 offsetPosition = float3( 0, 0, 64 * instanceID );
}
```

See:

* `Graphics.DrawModelInstanced( Model, count )`
* `Graphics.DrawModelInstancedIndirect( Model, GpuBuffer )`
