# Custom Snapshot Data

In some circumstances you may want to add additional data to the network snapshot that gets sent to clients when they join a server. One example of this might be serializing and deserializing voxel world data.


[Components](/scene/components/index.md) in the [Scene](/scene/scenes/index.md) can write and read their own data during the snapshot sending and receiving process by implementing `Component.INetworkSnapshot`.


# Writing Snapshot Data

To write snapshot data for a Component you can simply override the `WriteSnapshot` method on a component.


```csharp
  	private byte[] MyVoxelData { get; set; }
    
	void INetworkSnapshot.WriteSnapshot( ref ByteStream writer )
	{
        writer.Write( MyVoxelData.Length );
		writer.WriteArray( MyVoxelData );
	}
```


# Reading Snapshot Data

Reading snapshot data can be done by overriding `ReadSnapshot` on a component. You can return a Task here to have the loading screen wait for this to be done before continuing.


```csharp
	void INetworkSnapshot.ReadSnapshot( ref ByteStream reader )
	{
        var length = reader.Read<int>();
        MyVoxelData = reader.ReadArray<byte>( length ).ToArray();
	}
 
    protected override Task OnLoad()
    {
        await LoadVoxelWorld( MyVoxelData );
    }

	private Task LoadVoxelWorld( byte[] data )
	{
		// ...
	}
```
