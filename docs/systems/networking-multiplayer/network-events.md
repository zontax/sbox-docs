# Network Events

Your games will likely want to react to people joining and leaving the game. To help with this you can implement `Component.INetworkListener` or `Component.INetworkSpawn` on a component and place it in the scene.


# Example


Here's an example, where on joining the game a player object is created and the incoming player is assigned as the owner.


```csharp
public sealed class GameNetworkManager : Component, Component.INetworkListener
{
	[Property] public GameObject PlayerPrefab { get; set; }
	[Property] public GameObject SpawnPoint { get; set; }

	/// <summary>
	/// Called on the host when someone successfully joins the server (including the local player)
	/// </summary>
	public void OnActive( Connection connection )
	{
		// Spawn a player for this client
		var player = PlayerPrefab.Clone( SpawnPoint.Transform.World );

		// Find the NameTag component and set their name correctly
		var nameTag = player.Components.Get<NameTagPanel>( FindMode.EverythingInSelfAndDescendants );
		if ( nameTag is not null )
		{
			nameTag.Name = connection.DisplayName;
		}

		// Spawn it on the network, assign connection as the owner
		player.NetworkSpawn( connection );
	}
}
```


# INetworkListener


The interface `INetworkListener` has multiple methods that you can optionally override.

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `OnConnected` | The client has connected to the server. They're about to start handshaking, in which they'll load the game and download all the required packages. |
| `OnDisconnected` | The client has disconnected from the server. |
| `OnActive` | The client is fully connected and completely the handshake. After this call they will close the loading screen and start playing. |


# INetworkSpawn


The interface `INetworkSpawn` has a method to react to objects spawning on the network.

| **Method** | **Description** |
|--------|-------------|
| `OnNetworkSpawn` | Called when this object is spawned on the network. |
