# Razor Panels

UI can also be created using Razor, which allows you to use web-like HTML/CSS to create and style each Panel while also being able to leverage C#.

The panels are created and rendered exactly the same way. They don't use a HTML renderer. This syntax is a convenience.

# Creating a new PanelComponent

Every single UI consists of a [PanelComponent](https://sbox.game/api/Sandbox.PanelComponent) at the root, with normal [Panel](https://sbox.game/api/Sandbox.UI.Panel)s being the children/content within. The PanelComponent can be added to any GameObject that also has either a ScreenPanel or WorldPanel component, and it will be drawn to whichever it has.

When you create a new Component, select "New Razor Panel Component" to get the following:

```csharp
@using Sandbox;
@using Sandbox.UI;
@inherits PanelComponent

<root>
	<div class="title">@MyStringValue</div>
</root>

@code
{

	[Property, TextArea] public string MyStringValue { get; set; } = "Hello World!";

	/// <summary>
	/// the hash determines if the system should be rebuilt. If it changes, it will be rebuilt
	/// </summary>
	protected override int BuildHash() => System.HashCode.Combine( MyStringValue );
}
```

## HTML/Razor

Anything within the `<root>` tags is treated as HTML, allowing you to inject C# as-needed, like so:

```markup
<root>
  @foreach(var player in Player.All)
  {
    <div class="player">
      <label>@player.Name</label>
      @if(player.IsDead)
      {
        <img src="ui/skull.png" />
      }
    </div>
  }
</root>
```

If no `<root>` element is present, then any and all elements will be a child of your Panel's root automatically.

You can also `return` early in Razor if you don't want it to render anything beyond the specified line.

## BuildHash

A Panel's contents will only be rebuilt if the value returned from BuildHash() has changed from the previous value, so make sure to include certain values here to ensure the Panel updates when necessary.

A Panel's contents will also rebuild if if has `pointer-events` and the cursor enters/exits/clicks the Panel.

You can also force a rebuild by calling `StateHasChanged()`. This will queue the rebuild for the next frame.

# Creating a new Panel

Since a PanelComponent is the root, any child elements are instead Panels. These are created in the exact same way PanelComponents are, but instead inheriting the Panel class (which `.razor` files do by default):

```csharp
@using Sandbox;
@using Sandbox.UI;

<root>
  <div class="health">HP: @Health</div>
  <div class="armor">Armor: @Armor</div>
</root>

@code
{
  public int Health { get; set; } = 100;
  public int Armor { get; set; } = 100;
  
  protected override int BuildHash() => System.HashCode.Combine( Health, Armor );
}
```

## How to Use

Back in your PanelComponent (or any other Panel), you can simply use the panel like any other element:

```csharp
<MyChildPanel />
```

And can even pass variables to the Panel like so:

```csharp
<MyChildPanel Health=@(30) Armor=@(75) />
```

## How to store a Panel Reference

If you wish to store a reference to MyChildPanel so you can modify its properties in code, you can do this:

```csharp
<root>
  <MyChildPanel @ref="PanelReference" />
</root>

@code
{
  MyChildPanel PanelReference { get; set; }
  
  protected override void OnStart()
  {
    PanelReference.Health = Player.Local.Health;
    PanelReference.Armor = Player.Local.Armor;
  }
}
```

## Two Way Binds

Sometimes you want to bind a variable to a control, and if it changes, sync the value back. That's what this is.

You create a two way bind using `:bind` after the attribute name:

```csharp
<SliderEntry min="0" max="100" step="1" Value:bind=@IntValue></SliderEntry>

@code
{
	public int IntValue{ get; set; } = 32;
}
```

The example above will update the Slider when IntValue changes, and IntValue when the Slider changes

## Differences between Panel and PanelComponent

Since a Panel is not a Component, you cannot override `OnStart`, `OnUpdate`, ect.\nInstead Panel has `OnAfterTreeRender(bool firstTime)` and `Tick()`.

Since PanelComponent is not a Panel, you have to access it's Panel via the [PanelComponent.Panel](https://sbox.game/api/Sandbox.PanelComponent/Panel) accessor.\nThis means where you can do `Style.Left = Length.Auto` on a Panel, you have to do\n`Panel.Style.Left = Length.Auto` on a PanelComponent.

This also means you cannot do `<MyPanelComponent />` within another Panel/PanelComponent, they must be added to a GameObject with a ScreenPanel or WorldPanel.
