# Localization

When displaying text such as `Hello World`, you should instead use a localization token like `#menu.helloworld`. This will automatically replace the text with the corresponding language set by the user when set on a Label, allowing you to easily support multiple languages.

# Tokens

In UI, any displayed string that begins with a `#` will be recognized as a token, which means it will look for it's real value in the localization system.

# Example

Filename: `Localization/en/sandbox.json`

```json
{
  "menu.helloworld": "Hello World",
  "spawnmenu.props": "Models",
  "spawnmenu.tools": "Tools"
  "spawnmenu.cloud": "sbox.game",
}
```

Then it's as easy as doing the following:

```markup
<label>#spawnmenu.props</label>
```
