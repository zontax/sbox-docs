# S&box Documentation

# About

S&box is coded in C#. Under the hood, it uses the Source 2 engine (CS2, HL:Alyx, DOTA2) and some of its systems: rendering, resources, physics, and audio.

When you create games and addons in s&box, you will be creating them in C#.

We have developed a hotload system which is capable of compiling & hotloading your changes to code within a few milliseconds, which negates the need for a scripting language.

# Scenes

We use a scene system, similar to Godot and Unity. This allows faster iteration, without everything being code-based. The scene system aims to make how everything works more transparent, by being easily visible, and easily accessible.

# Future

Our intention is to let you export the things that you make in our engine and release them standalone. We'll let you do this royalty-free.
