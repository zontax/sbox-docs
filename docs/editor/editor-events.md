# Editor Events

Editor Events are events that are broadcast globally throughout the editor and can be listened to/fired from any [Editor Project](/editor/editor-project.md). These are useful for creating your own custom Editor Tools and making sure they can work in tandem with existing systems.

# Hooking into an EditorEvent

Hooking into an Editor Event allows you to run additional code whenever an event is called. You can control the order at which event hooks are triggered via the `Priority` variable. Events with a lower Priority run first.

```csharp
// Hooking into a named event
[Event( "scene.stop", Priority = 100 )]
void OnSceneStop()
{
  Log.Info( "The scene has stopped" );
}

// Shorthands for frequently used events
[EditorEvent.Hotload]
void OnHotload()
{
  Log.Info( "You've hotloaded!" );
}
```

Just make sure that you have the same arguments that the EditorEvent is looking for. See the table below.

# Calling a Custom EditorEvent

```csharp
// Calling an event with 0-3 arguments
EditorEvent.Run( "customevent.test" ); // No arguments
EditorEvent.Run( "customevent.add", 1, 2); // 2 arguments

// Calling an event via an interface (theoretically unlimited arguments)
// This will run the event on any Editor Widget that implements the custom interface
EditorEvent.RunInterface<ICustomEvent>( x => x.MyCustomEvent(1,2,3,4,5) );
```

# Event Interfaces

While string-based events still exist, we prefer to use event interfaces nowadays. We find that they're more stable than strings. It's more obvious if things are using it, and it's really IntelliSense friendly.


To use the interface, you just implement it. They're coded in a way that means you don't have to implement each member, so you can just implement what you want to listen to.


```csharp
public class MyCustomWidget : Widget, ResourceLibrary.IEventListener
{
	void ResourceLibrary.IEventListener.OnRegister( GameResource resource )
	{
		Log.Info( $"{resource} has been registered!" );
	}
}
```



:::tip
For widgets event listeners will register automatically, if you want to listen to events on a non widget class you will manually need to call `EditorEvent.Register( myCustomListenerInstance );`

# AssetSystem.IEventListener

```csharp

/// <summary>
/// An asset has been modified
/// </summary>
void OnAssetChanged( Asset asset ) { }

/// <summary>
/// The thumbnail for an asset has been updated
/// </summary>
void OnAssetThumbGenerated( Asset asset ) { }

/// <summary>
/// Changes have been detected in the asset system. We won't tell you what, but
/// you probably need to update the asset list or something.
/// </summary>
void OnAssetSystemChanges() { }

/// <summary>
/// Called when a new tag has been added to the asset system.
/// </summary>
void OnAssetTagsChanged() { }
```


# ResourceLibrary.IEventListener

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Called when a new resource has been registered
/// </summary>
void OnRegister( GameResource resource ) { }

/// <summary>
/// Called when a previously known resource has been unregistered
/// </summary>
void OnUnregister( GameResource resource ) { }

/// <summary>
/// Called when the source file of a known resource has been externally modified on disk
/// </summary>
void OnExternalChanges( GameResource resource ) { }

/// <summary>
/// Called when the source file of a known resource has been externally modified on disk
/// and after it has been fully loaded (after post load is called)
/// </summary>
void OnExternalChangesPostLoad( GameResource resource ) { }
```
